## Why Mask?

There are many company's and laboratories around the world that trying to treat people that got infected by the covid-19 virus. Problem is that this solution will take a long time to develop and test before we can use them. I our opinion by the time some of them will be able to produce a treatment, it might be too late. Hence, we need to find a way to handle the situation in the immediate term, or all least decrease and postpone it until such treatment will be available. 

There are two parameters we need to look at: number of infected people, number of available hospital bed / ventilators. When we observed the disease status around the world we discovered few thing:
- There is a corelation between the number of infarcted people and the umber of infarcted people that need a hospital care.
- Number of infarcted people is a lot grater then the number of available hospital bed / ventilators.

We deduced that making / purchasing ventilators, and creating more hospital beds will only delay slightly the outbreak, due to the complexity of achieving both of these task. In our opinion, the best way is to **avoiding getting infected & avoiding infection others**. There are two main way to do this: **social distasting** & **wearing protection (mask & gloves)**. We are all practising social distancing, but unfortunately, not all of use wearing protection (due to shortage or because they lake to understand their merits).


## Wearing Protection

We define how contagious an infectious disease is be observing the average number of people who will catch a disease from one contagious person. we denote this value R0. 
- If R0 is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.
- If R0 equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there wonâ€™t be an outbreak or an epidemic.
- If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will spread between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.

The R0 value of flu is 1.3, the R0 value of covid-19 is 2 - 2.5. It might to seem much but take a look at following example: after 10 rounds of infection, the flu virus can infect around 56 people, after the number of rounds covid-19 will infect 2047 people. Moreover, in contrary to the flu, nobody have antibodies against covid-19, which mean there in nothing stopping it from infecting more people. Furthermore, covid-19 symptom's can appear two weeks after one was infected, causing him to infect much more people. Wearing proper protection can prevent spreading the infection; More simperingly, research shows that wearing a simple cloth as a mask can lower the R0 value closer to 1!. Hence, we decided to design a mask to help reduce disease reproduction value to 0.
