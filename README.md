## Why Mask?

In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan province, China, caused a crisis around the wrold.
Since then, many company's and laboratories around the world trying to develop a treatment for people that got infected by the covid-19 virus. Problem is, this solutions will take a long time to develop and test before we can use them. 
In our opinion, by the time some of them will be able to produce a treatment, it might be too late. 
Hence, we need to find a way to handle the situation in the immediate term, or at least decrease and postpone it until such treatment will be available.

here are two parameters we need to take into account: the number of infected people, and the number of available hospital capacity to treat people. 

When we observed the disease status around the world, we discovered few things:
- There is a corelation between the number of infected people and the number of infected people that need a hospital care.
- The number of infected people is a lot grater then the health care capacity.

We deduced that making / purchasing ventilators, and creating more hospital beds will only delay slightly the outbreak, due to the complexity of achieving both of these task. 
In our opinion, the best solution is to **avoid getting infected & avoiding infecting others!** 
There are two main way's to achieve this goal: **social distancing & wearing protection**. 
We are all practising social distancing, but unfortunately, not all of us wearing protection (due to shortage or because they lake to understand their merits).

## Mask Features

We designed the respirator with health care __physicians__ in mind, but kept it __simple__ so it will be suitable to be used by most of the population. 

### Simple
We designed the respirator carefully such that it would be possible to produce it without special hardware (due to the mobility restrictions during the epidemic).

### Safe
The respirator contains a big detachable filter at it front, we used industrial filters due to their high efficiency and their availability.

### Modular
The mask design to accepts high verity of commercial filters and cartridges.
But also design to accept self made filter (that can be cut from HEPA filters such as vacuum bags, AC filters etc..).

### Breathable
The respirator contains a big detachable filter at it's front, the big surface area should allow air filtration with less air pressure drop. This make is easy to breath. In combination to the dual outlet valve, it should be easier to communicate through the mask (which is very important to physicians).

### Reuseable Replaceable Filter
Our filter cartidge is detachable, and it can be replace if it's wears out.
To attach / detach the filter, align the marks that can be found on the  mask and on the filter and rotate it 45 degrees.

### Comfortable
We designed a big rubber seal between the mask and the user face. 
This will allow creating a better seal while reducing the pressure that is applied on the user face.
this allows the respirator to be wear for a longer time with out feeling uncomfortable, and without injuring the user.

### Sanitizable
due to its modular design, the mask can be sanitized separately without the filter, and reassembled with ease after the sanitization is done.

## Build Instructions

You can find detailed manufacturing and build instruction throughout each directory in this repository.

### Table of Contents
- **Assets**
  - **Models folder**: contain all the models and instruction for manufacturing using computerized manufacturing methods.
  - **Schematics folder**: contain all the schematics and manufacturing methud priorty using manual manufacturing methods.
- **BOM**: contain bill of materials for the best possible outcome, all the parts in here can be manufactured as well.

## Wearing Protection

We define how contagious an infectious disease is, by observing the number of people who will get infected on average from one contagious person. We denote this value R0.
- If R0 is less than 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.
- If R0 equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay alive and stable, but there won’t be an outbreak or an epidemic.
- If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The disease will spread between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.

he R0 value of flu is 1.3, the R0 value of covid-19 is 2 - 2.5. It might not seems much, but take a look at this following prediction. After 10 rounds of infection, the flu virus can infect around 56 people, after the same number of rounds, the covid-19 virus will infect about 2,047 people!  
Moreover, in contrary to the flu, nobody have antibodies against covid-19 yet, which means there is nothing stopping it from infecting more people. 
Furthermore, covid-19 symptom's can appear two weeks after one was infected, causing him to infect much more people. 

Wearing proper protection can prevent spreading the infection. More impressively, research shows that wearing a simple cloth as a mask can lower the R0 value by a third!. 
Hence, we decided to design a mask to help reduce the disease reproduction value to 0, in conjunction to protecting health care physicians.
